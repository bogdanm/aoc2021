This repository contains my solutions to https://adventofcode.com/2021/. I have two main goals for this year's AoC:

* The "well doh" goal: complete all the puzzles.
* The "ah this is interesting" goal: code the solution for each day in a different programming language. This is going to be challenging, but also very exciting.

Additionally, I'll try to write at least some semi-decent code, so that I won't be ashamed to make this repository public at some point in the future.

Solutions for each day are organized in subdirectories named `day<number>-<language>`. Short (and incomplete) instructions for running the solution are given in each `README.md` file in the subdirectories. Some READMEs also contain notes about the algorithm used to solve the puzzle and/or about the language used for implementing the solution to the puzzle.

Coded and tested in Linux Mint 20.2 x64. The solutions are not completely cross-platform; for example, the solution for the first day is implemented in assembly and will only run in Linux, on an Intel 64-bit machine. That said, most (if not all) of the other solutions should be platform-independent.
