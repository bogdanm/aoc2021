Solution to https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/11 in [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/).

To build and run:

- Install `racket` from https://download.racket-lang.org/ (I used the "Ubuntu PPA" method).

# Notes

I've always admired LISP (and Scheme by extension). The amount of innovation that it brought to the programming language world is hard to match, and the fact that it is almost entirely built around a very simple data structure (a linked list) is nothing short of amazing. Unfortunately my coding experience with LISP is very limited, thus my solution for today's puzzle isn't very LISPy. But I still enojoyed the opportunity to play a bit with lists and S-expressions, even when my lack of experience with LISP made the experience feel a bit frustrating. Also, I found Racket's error messages more confusing than helpful at times.
