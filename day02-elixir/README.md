# Overview

Solution to https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/2 in [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/).

To build and run:

- Install Elixir using your preferred method from https://elixir-lang.org/install.html#gnulinux. The Ubuntu method didn't work for me (maybe because I'm using Mint instead of Ubuntu?), so I used `brew install erlang`. **NOTE**: this is a fairly big installation, probably just a bit under 2GB.
- `elixir solution.exs`
