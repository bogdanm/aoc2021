# Notes

The first time I looked at Swift a few years ago I found it to be an interesting language with some cool features (to put things into perspective, Rust didn't exist back then). However, I didn't pay much attention to it, since I didn't (and still don't) own any computer that can run OSX, and the Linux support was very basic at the time. My goal for this year's AoC made me revisit the language, and I'm glad I did. Support for Linux has improved significantly, and the language grew quite a bit and gained some modern features (for example built in support for async programming). I am not an iOS/OSX developer and I don't have any practical use case for the language yet, but I'll keep an eye on it just in case.
