# Overview

Solution to https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/9 in [D](https://dlang.org/).

To build and run:

- Install `dmd` from https://dlang.org/download.html#dmd (I used the "install script" method).
- `source ~/dlang/dmd-2.098.0/activate` (which also shows what version of DMD I used).
- `rdmd solution.d`

# Notes

I think `D` is an interesting and quite underrated language, definitely better than C++. Is it worth investing the time and effort to learn it in 2021? I honestly don't know. Are you looking for a C++ alternative and feel that `Rust` is not for you? Then yes, I'd probably recommend giving `D` a try (obviously this is a very simplified perspective that ignores other (very important) aspects, like platform and library support).
